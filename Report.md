## Learning Algorithm

The agent is trained with the [Multi Agent DDPG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275). The full algorithm is described in the METHODS section of the paper.

The information flow in a MADDPG algorithm is depeicted below (Screenshot from the paper)

## Parameters

- BUFFER_SIZE = int(1e5)  # replay buffer size
- BATCH_SIZE = 250         # minibatch size
- GAMMA = 0.99            # discount factor
- TAU = 1e-3              # for soft update of target parameters
- LR_ACTOR = 1e-4         # learning rate of the actor
- LR_CRITIC = 1e-3        # learning rate of the critic 2539
- WEIGHT_DECAY = 0        # L2 weight decay

## Architecture of each of the 2 Agents

Actor

- 2 fully connected layers with 200 and 150 units each

Critic

- 2 fully connected layers with 200 and 150 units each

ReplayBuffer

- A fixed size buffer of size 1e5

## Observations/Issues

* The Agent was initially training very slowly but picked up rewards fast after around 800 episodes. 

## Trained Models

- The ```agent1_checkpoint_actor.pth``` file represents the first agent actor
- The ```agent1_checkpoint_critic.pth``` file represents the first agent critic
- The ```agent2_checkpoint_actor.pth``` file represents the second agent actor
- The ```agent2_checkpoint_critic.pth``` file represents the second agent critic

## Further Improvements
The following techniques can be tried out to further improve the performance of the network
- [Prioritized Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952): This technique prioritizes the experiences and chooses the best experience for further training when sampling from the buffer. This is known to reduce the training time and make the training more efficient.
- [Asynchornous Actor Critic Agent](https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-8-asynchronous-actor-critic-agents-a3c-c88f72a5e9f2): This technique trains multiple worker agents that interact with a glocal network asynchronously to optimize the policy and value function. This way, each of these agents interacts with itâ€™s own copy of the environment at the same time as the other agents are interacting with their environments.
- [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347): This technique modifies the parameters of the network in such a way that the new set of parameters is looked for in the immediate neighbourhood of the parameters in the previous iteration of the training. This is shown also to be an efficient way of training the network so the search space is more optimal.
